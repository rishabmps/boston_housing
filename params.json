Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.\r\n\r\n###Keywords\r\n\r\nStatistical Analysis, Metric Performance, Cross Validatio,n bias/underfitting & variance overfitting, Learning Curves, Model Complexity and  Model Tuning\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nThis project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:\r\n\r\n- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\r\n- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)\r\n- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\r\n\r\nYou will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)\r\n\r\nI recommend to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. \r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\n Code is provided in the `boston_housing.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `housing.csv` dataset file to complete your work.\r\n\r\n### Run\r\n\r\nIn a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `boston_housing/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:\r\n\r\n```ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb```  \r\n\r\nThis will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.\r\n\r\n### Data\r\n\r\nThe dataset used in this project is included with the scikit-learn library ([`sklearn.datasets.load_boston`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html#sklearn.datasets.load_boston)). You do not have to download it separately. You can find more information on this dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing) page.\r\n\r\n",
